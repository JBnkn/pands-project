# Programming and Scripting project

## Introduction
This repository contains my analysis of the famous [Iris flower dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). I utilised the [dataset found here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) for the purposes of my analysis. This analysis was carried out as an end-of-module project for the [Programming and Scripting](https://www.gmit.ie/programming-and-scripting) module as part of the [Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics at ATU](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics):

> This project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set. You must research the data set and write documentation and code (in Python) to investigate it. An online search for information on the data set will convince you that many people have investigated it previously. You are expected to be able to break this project into several smaller tasks that are easier to solve, and to plug these together after they have been completed.
